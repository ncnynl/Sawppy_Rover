**Note:** Before attaching the rear body portion to the body sides, the last 4 of the [Installation tools for 3 M3 nuts, 20mm apart](Print%20M3%20Installation%20Tool.md) should be installed in the top beam of the right and left body sides for future installation of the [Differential End Pieces](../STL/DiffEnd.stl) during the [Suspension Differential Assembly](AssembleDifferential.md). They are installed in the top and outside slots of the top beams.

For proportion faithful to Curiosity rover side view seen in Onshape CAD file, there should be 62mm of aluminum extrusion visible between front face of "Rocker Body mount" and rear face of front "Body Corner".

In practice this can be moved forward/back as the builder pleases to maintain best balance for their rover chassis. Which will vary with every rover build as it depends on what's installed in equipment bay.
