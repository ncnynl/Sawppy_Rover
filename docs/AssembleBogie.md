The 122mm extrusion connects the Bogie Wheel part on the straight side, and the Fixed Knuckle. The extrusion extends from the open side of the Fixed knuckle.

The Rear Corner should extend out away from the body when the assembly is mounted.

## Sawppy V1 Errata
Sawppy v1 has a design flaw where it is easy to make the mistake of using the
left side Bogie-Wheel part on the right side of the rover. (And vice-versa.) Several
rover builders were caught by this, and I am contemplating several ways to improve. In the
meantime please be aware: If a Sawppy rover's two middle wheels are splayed out
rather than parallel with each other and aligned with the body, it is because their
Bogie-Wheel parts had been installed left-right reversed from intended. (Thanks to
[Tim](https://hackaday.io/timing2211) for sharing these pictures.)

Correct | Bogie-Wheel part reversed left-right
